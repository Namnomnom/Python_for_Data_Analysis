# Python_for_Data_Analysis

In this project, we received a series of tasks focused on Python for data analysis. To complete these tasks, we made use of the most essential and widely-used libraries in the Python data ecosystem, including:
- NumPy for numerical operations and efficient array handling
- Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- CSV and JSON libraries for reading and writing structured data
- Jupyter Notebooks for interactive code and result presentation
- The tasks helped us apply these libraries to real-world scenarios such as:
- Importing, cleaning, and transforming datasets
- Performing statistical calculations and aggregations
- Visualizing trends, distributions, and correlations in the data
- Writing modular and reusable Python code for analysis pipelines

This project served as a strong foundation for understanding how data is structured, processed, and interpreted in Python â€” an essential skill set for anyone working in data science, analytics, or AI.
